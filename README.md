## Fan Art in 3D

I was inspired to make this giant, robotic scorpion with gatling guns by the [Wasteland 2](http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/) guys. I [Kickstarted](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/inxile/wasteland-2) this game this spring and they started cranking out concept art, some of which includes such a [robotic scorpion](http://wasteland.inxile-entertainment.com/images/press/wl2S-800x600.jpg). It's set as my desktop wallpaper, so the last time I needed a 3D-modeling/printing challenge I found it staring me in the face. So, I dusted off my [Tinkercad](https://tinkercad.com/users/jwAuHepfU5l-loren-norman) skills and set to work...

## Construction

All told, this is about 15 separate prints. The pieces have little male/female affordances so that it goes together easily, just needs a little superglue. And I took the hobby knife to the gnarly bits to smooth things up. (A dremel tool sanding would be better, but that's for V2.)

I primed it "desert yellow" and set about painting it. The guns are silvery of course, I also mixed up a deeper, more vibrant yellow for the carapace and a dark green for the underbelly. Then I dry-brushed it with a bright yellow (not the best effect because the print lines are pretty obvious in places) and splashed on a quick-shade.

## Fun!

All told it probably took about 20 hours of modeling, printing, and painting, but I could make new ones in more like 5 or 8 hours. Not "worth my time", strictly speaking, but boy was this fun!
